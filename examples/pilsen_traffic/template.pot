After the matrix calculation the counts of vehicles among all the traffic generators are portrayed on the road network, while the ideal (fastest) route together with the capacity of streets and crossroads is taken into account. The resulting traffic volume is subsequently calibrated by the street measurements of vehicles counts at selected locations. In order to display the traffic volume in the dynamic web application, the colour scheme of five colours (from green to red) is used to represent the traffic volume, matching the five traffic volume levels used by the Police (see the Legend). The figures displayed on the road segments represent the expected amount of vehicles on the street per hour."
